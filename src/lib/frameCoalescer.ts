// rAF frame-coalescing policy — ported from the desktop renderer's
// `src/renderer/kessel-term/frameCoalescer.ts` (behavior must stay
// equivalent: this is Kessel's frame pacing).
//
// WS snapshot/delta messages queue here and apply once per animation
// frame: one apply (→ one render) per display refresh, however many
// messages arrived. A queued full snapshot supersedes everything
// before it (the batch's merge starts from the snapshot, so earlier
// frames are dead weight). The size cap flushes synchronously if rAF
// is starved (backgrounded webview) so the queue can't grow unbounded.
//
// This module owns POLICY only — queue contents and when to flush.
// The scheduler (requestAnimationFrame / cancelAnimationFrame) and
// the applier (merge into the GridModel, render, k1 ack) are injected
// by TerminalView, which keeps this pure and testable in plain Node
// (see scripts/test-k1-wire.mjs).

// Seam color — iTerm-style "extend background color to edges".
//
// A fullscreen TUI paints its own background per-cell over exactly
// cols×rows, but the pane's pixel size rarely divides evenly by the
// cell size: the quantization remainder (right edge + bottom edge, up
// to one cell each plus rounding) shows the pane container's THEME
// background instead of the TUI's, producing a visible seam. Fix:
// examine the boundary cells of the visible grid and, when a strict
// majority of them share one explicit background color, paint the
// container with that color so the remainder blends into the TUI.
//
// Pure and allocation-light — this runs once per committed frame.

// TerminalPainter seam — the contract between the session view and the
// WebGL2 painter.
//
// The painter is a pure consumer sitting DOWNSTREAM of everything the
// view already owns: WS lifecycle, `mergeDelta`, the rAF frame
// coalescer, and all DOM overlays. It receives the merged snapshot +
// scroll position + selection + theme on React commits AND, while
// scrolling, directly from the view's display-aligned scroll rAF
// (the vsync scroll pump — commit-cadence painting was the scroll-hop
// cause). It never talks to the wire and never schedules its own
// frames — `render()` is the only entry point, which is what keeps
// the DOM strip a one-flag-flip fallback.
